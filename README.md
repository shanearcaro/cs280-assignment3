## Recursive Decent Parser

This assignment has a connection to the previous assignment of creating a Lexical Analyzer. The Recursive Decent Parser uses a simple Grammar to determine syntactical errors by comparing Tokes and the Grammar's strucutre.

## Implementation

The Recursive Decent Parser uses a Lexical Analyzer as a front to determine what type of Token a string of text is within a file. The Tokens are used in the Parser to find syntax errors by comparing them to a basic language grammar that defines how the language works.
